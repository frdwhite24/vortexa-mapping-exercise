# Vortexa mapping exercise

The coding challenge for Vortexa as per the guidelines [here](https://github.com/JRGranell/javascript-challenge).

## How to run locally

The repository is set up using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) and so dependencies are kept at the root level. The API and web applications can be run with the following commands:

``````````bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# API
npm start -w api

# Web application
npm start -w web
``````````

TODO: get these to work with just `npm start -ws`.
